There is an estimated 15 dead people for every person alive today, additionally somebody once told me that a hooking factoid was a good way to open up a writing piece. 

I am a 3rd year Management Science and Information Systems Studies student in Trinity College Dublin. I enjoy coding and long walks on the beach. Particularly I am a fan of education gamification, financial technology data analytics/visualisation and AI using languages such as Java, Python, R, VBA, Javascript,etc.
